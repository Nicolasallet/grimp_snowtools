# grimp_snowtools


This repo provides some functions that could be either used directly or serve as an example to work with the snowpits data gathered by the GRIMP artic teams since 2018.

Data is organized by folder, with one folder for each snowpit. In each folder, a 'site' folder contains a csv file with general information about the snowpit. This information can also be found in a metadata file (only available for the year 2024 for the moment). 

 A 'stratigraphy' folder contains a csv with the stratygraphy of the snowpack made according to the International classification for seasonal snow on the ground (Fierz et al., 2008). 

It works in the same way for the density and temperature folders. The iris folder contains ssa measurement made according to Montpetit et al. (2012).


This set of data can be found on the GRIMP cloud or by requesting it to Nicolas.Allet@USherbrooke.ca
